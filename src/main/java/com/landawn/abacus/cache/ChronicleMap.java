/**
 * A placeholder class for Chronicle Map integration.
 * Chronicle Map is a high-performance, off-heap, key-value store that provides
 * concurrent access with strong consistency guarantees. This class is intended
 * to provide integration with Chronicle Map in the Abacus caching framework.
 * 
 * <br><br>
 * Chronicle Map features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Off-heap storage to reduce GC pressure</li>
 * <li>Memory-mapped files for persistence</li>
 * <li>Zero-copy operations</li>
 * <li>Lock-free reads under MVCC</li>
 * <li>Excellent performance for concurrent access</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <br>
 * Note: This is currently a placeholder implementation. The actual implementation
 * would wrap Chronicle Map's functionality to conform to the Abacus Cache interface.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map">Chronicle-Map on GitHub</a>
